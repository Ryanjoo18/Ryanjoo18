 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Ryan Joo's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 My coding journey has been a progressive exploration. It began in 2019 with Python, primarily focused on problem-solving through platforms such as Codeforces. In early 2023, I picked up LaTeX, honing the skill to write professional papers effectively. Later in the same year, my interest expanded as I familiarised myself with HTML and CSS to craft and personalise my website. Presently, I am actively engaged in learning R and SQL, further enriching my programming repertoire.
